\usage{
prepSeries(df, x1, x2, y)

prepSeries(df, x1, x2, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{This is the data source to be converted}

\item{x1}{This is the first column to be grouped by}

\item{x2}{This is the second column to be grouped by}

\item{y}{This is the column to summarise by taking the mean}

\item{df}{This is the data source to be converted}

\description{
This function converts a data frame to a summary data frame that can be converted to a series for use in highcharter

This function converts a data frame to a summary data frame that can be converted to a series for use in highcharter.  The difference between this funciton and prepSeries is that this function uses sum as an aggregation rather than mean.
